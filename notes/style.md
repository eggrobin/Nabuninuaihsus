## 𒋙 ŠÚ

𒌋 or 𒀹? We pick 𒀹.

## 𒄇 GIDIM

In 𒌷𒀏, looks oddly more like Labat’s MA style than its (or Borger’s) NA: https://cdli.ucla.edu/dl/photo/P395656.jpg; 𒋙 on the left instead of 𒁹, no long horizontal wedge running at the bottom.

## 𒄰 ḪI×BAD (KAM)

Recall that NA 𒄭 looks like 𒎗.

Either
1. 𒎗𒁁 (Borger KAM), e.g., https://cdli.ucla.edu/dl/photo/P394548.jpg;
2. Something that looks like OB 𒆚 (Borger KAMᵛ), e.g., https://cdli.ucla.edu/dl/photo/P398192.jpg or https://cdli.ucla.edu/dl/photo/P398192.jpg.

Went for 2.

Bear in mind that NA𒆚 KÁM is horizontal.

## 𒎌 MEŠ

In 𒌷𒀏 𒎌 = 𒈨+𒌍 seems anachronistic. 
The options seem to be 
1. 𒈦+𒌍 or
2. 𒈨+𒐁/𒁹+𒐁,

the latter more frequent but the former attested here and there. Labat lists the former as NB rather than NA. Went for 2.

## 𒉪 NUN&NUN

Looks roughly like 𒋰𒑖𒑖𒑖𒑖, but the last 𒑖 gets emphasized. This is not the case for 𒉣 NUN.
