## Generalities

### Attestations

If a sign cannot be found in a neo-Assyrian tablet (preferably from 𒌷𒀏), or at least in a middle Assyrian
tablet in a style consistent with the neo-Assyrian signs, no attempt is made at including it in the font, even
if it is an &-, @-, <sup>180</sup>-, or 4×- composition of attested signs.  We look, ideally, for photographs;
failing that, for autographs. We do not use the glyphs from modern sign lists (Labat, Borger, etc.) as references.

#### Rationale

To quote 𒁹𒍣𒊬,
> Who are we to presume no simplifications would be made[?]

Modern sign lists tend to condense broader style variation than we aim for here, and occasionaly miss some subtler
details.

### Composite signs

When a composite sign is frequent enough, we look for systematic divergences between the composite and its
components, and observe those.  These range from the obvious (especially in ×-signs; 𒀊 in NA 𒀊×X, e.g.,
𒀊×𒄩=𒀏, is very different from self-standing NA 𒀊) to the subtle (see 𒉪 vs. 𒉣 below, generally not
reflected in sign lists but consistently visible on tablets).

However, when the composite sign is rare and the composition is by juxtaposition and rigid motion
(., +, &, @, <sup>180</sup>, 4×)—as opposed to crossing (%) or nesting (×) which almost always leads to
some adjustment in neo-Assyrian styles—we use attestations to confirm that the composition remains accurate,
and to check for resizing, but otherwise compose our own glyphs instead of mimicking the style of the
attestations.

In other words, if:
1. 𝑋 and 𝔛 are neo-Assyrian styles of sign X,
2. the glyph for X in 𒀭𒀝𒌷𒀏𒄴𒋢𒊻 is 𝔛,
3. neo-Assyrian attestations of X&X are hard to come by,
4. we find a tablet which writes 𝑋 as 𝑋, and X&X as 𝑋&𝑋,

The glyph for X&X in 𒀭𒀝𒌷𒀏𒄴𒋢𒊻 will be 𝔛&𝔛.

#### Rationale

We consider that rare and complex signs would likely be thought of as compositions of more common ones, and thus
that no scribe would write 𒉀 differently in 𒀱—which they would write exceedingly rarely.

In contrast, when etymologically composite are common (in particular when they have basic syllabic values, e.g.
𒉪 NIR = NUN&NUN vs. 𒉣 NUN), they may be learned as separate signs, and thus diverge; however in that case,
we have an ample supply of examples with which to tease out the systematic divergence from the individual styles.

## Observations on individual signs

### 𒀱 4×(AN.NAGA) (DALḪAMUN₄)

The scribe of our only NA attestation, https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/object/W_K-4349,
uses tilted wedges on the left-hand-side of 𒊬, 𒉀, etc., rather than the horizontal wedges we use.

We use this attestation to guide the composition of the sign (which is just « as written », there are no
structural simplifications and no reduction in size), but we use our glyph for 𒉀 in 𒀱, rather than
mimicking those of K. 4349.

### 𒊬 ŠAR

The left-hand-side varies, we went with https://cdli.ucla.edu/search/archival_view.php?ObjectID=P396599.

### 𒁴 DIM (TIM)

Highly variable in style.

TODO(egg): list an exemplar for the style we picked.

### 𒄇 GIDIM

In 𒌷𒀏, looks oddly more like Labat’s MA style than its (or Borger’s) NA: https://cdli.ucla.edu/dl/photo/P395656.jpg; 𒋙 on the left instead of 𒁹, no long horizontal wedge running at the bottom.

### 𒄰 ḪI×BAD (KAM)

Recall that NA 𒄭 looks like 𒎗.

Either
1. 𒎗𒁁 (Borger KAM), e.g., https://cdli.ucla.edu/dl/photo/P394548.jpg;
2. Something that looks like OB 𒆚 (Borger KAMᵛ), e.g., https://cdli.ucla.edu/dl/photo/P398192.jpg or https://cdli.ucla.edu/dl/photo/P398192.jpg.

Went for 2.

Bear in mind that NA𒆚 KÁM is horizontal. This tablet has them both, with KAM as KAMᵛ: https://cdli.ucla.edu/search/search_results.php?SearchMode=Text&ObjectID=P365742.

### 𒄷 ḪU (MUŠEN)

Went for something like 𒈦𒋙 instead of 𒈦𒌋𒁹 as in Labat or Borger, e.g. http://oracc.iaas.upenn.edu/blms/P357120/html r 8′ in *us* 𒊻 = ŠE.ḪU 𒊺.𒄷.

### 𒆦 KISAL

In NA, looks like, and in Labat is identified with, a 𒉌𒄑 ligature.  Three styles in 𒌷𒀏, depending on which of the horizontal wedges of the 𒉌 touch the vertical wedge of the 𒄑:
1. neither, i.e. 𒉌+𒄑, e.g., https://cdli.ucla.edu/dl/lineart/P393735_l.jpg.
2. only the top one, e.g., https://cdli.ucla.edu/dl/lineart/P394491_l.jpg, https://cdli.ucla.edu/dl/lineart/P401722_l.jpg.
3. both, e.g., https://cdli.ucla.edu/dl/lineart/P397529_l.jpg; this is the style used by both Borger and Labat.

Went for 2.

### 𒋙 ŠÚ

𒌋 or 𒀹? We pick 𒀹.

### 𒎌 MEŠ

In 𒌷𒀏 𒎌 = 𒈨+𒌍 seems anachronistic. 
The options seem to be 
1. 𒈦+𒌍 or
2. 𒈨+𒐁/𒁹+𒐁,

the latter more frequent but the former attested here and there. Labat lists the former as NB rather than NA. Went for 2.

### 𒉪 NUN&NUN

Looks roughly like 𒋰𒑖𒑖𒑖𒑖, but the last 𒑖 gets emphasized. This is not the case for 𒉣 NUN.
