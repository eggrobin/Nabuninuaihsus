## 𒀱 4×(AN.NAGA) (DALḪAMUN₄)

The scribe of our only NA attestation, https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/object/W_K-4349,
uses tilted wedges on the left-hand-side of 𒊬, 𒉀, etc., rather than the horizontal wedges we use.

We use this attestation to guide the composition of the sign (which is just « as written », there are no
structural simplifications and no reduction in size), but we use our glyph for 𒉀 in 𒀱, rather than
mimicking those of K. 4349.

## 𒊬 ŠAR

The left-hand-side varies, we went with https://cdli.ucla.edu/search/archival_view.php?ObjectID=P396599.

## 𒁴 DIM (TIM)

Highly variable in style.

TODO(egg): list an exemplar for the style we picked.

## 𒄇 GIDIM

In 𒌷𒀏, looks oddly more like Labat’s MA style than its (or Borger’s) NA: https://cdli.ucla.edu/dl/photo/P395656.jpg; 𒋙 on the left instead of 𒁹, no long horizontal wedge running at the bottom.

## 𒄰 ḪI×BAD (KAM)

Recall that NA 𒄭 looks like 𒎗.

Either
1. 𒎗𒁁 (Borger KAM), e.g., https://cdli.ucla.edu/dl/photo/P394548.jpg;
2. Something that looks like OB 𒆚 (Borger KAMᵛ), e.g., https://cdli.ucla.edu/dl/photo/P398192.jpg or https://cdli.ucla.edu/dl/photo/P398192.jpg.

Went for 2.

Bear in mind that NA𒆚 KÁM is horizontal. This tablet has them both, with KAM as KAMᵛ: https://cdli.ucla.edu/search/search_results.php?SearchMode=Text&ObjectID=P365742.

## 𒄷 ḪU (MUŠEN)

Went for something like 𒈦𒋙 instead of 𒈦𒌋𒁹 as in Labat or Borger, e.g. http://oracc.iaas.upenn.edu/blms/P357120/html r 8′ in *us* 𒊻 = ŠE.ḪU 𒊺.𒄷.

## 𒆦 KISAL

In NA, looks like, and in Labat is identified with, a 𒉌𒄑 ligature.  Three styles in 𒌷𒀏, depending on which of the horizontal wedges of the 𒉌 touch the vertical wedge of the 𒄑:
1. neither, i.e. 𒉌+𒄑, e.g., https://cdli.ucla.edu/dl/lineart/P393735_l.jpg.
2. only the top one, e.g., https://cdli.ucla.edu/dl/lineart/P394491_l.jpg, https://cdli.ucla.edu/dl/lineart/P401722_l.jpg.
3. both, e.g., https://cdli.ucla.edu/dl/lineart/P397529_l.jpg; this is the style used by both Borger and Labat.

Went for 2.

## 𒋙 ŠÚ

𒌋 or 𒀹? We pick 𒀹.

## 𒎌 MEŠ

In 𒌷𒀏 𒎌 = 𒈨+𒌍 seems anachronistic. 
The options seem to be 
1. 𒈦+𒌍 or
2. 𒈨+𒐁/𒁹+𒐁,

the latter more frequent but the former attested here and there. Labat lists the former as NB rather than NA. Went for 2.

## 𒉪 NUN&NUN

Looks roughly like 𒋰𒑖𒑖𒑖𒑖, but the last 𒑖 gets emphasized. This is not the case for 𒉣 NUN.
